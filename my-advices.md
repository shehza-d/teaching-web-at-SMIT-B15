# My Advices for everyone

- know and understand your why (apko pata hone chiye ky ap koi kam kyu kr rahe ho)
- time management
  - fazool activities eliminate kardyn like cricket, games, spending time with friends, delete all social media
  - notice and analyze your time ky ye time ja kidher raha hy (specially screen time)
  - im not saying always study pharai ka dil nhi kr raha tw musjid, library or GYM chale jao and just sit their, only these 3 places you can spend unlimited time baki kahi bhi time waste nhi karna
- be consistent (no absent)
- practice (coding is like swimming ye dekh kr nhi krky aati hy ONLY)

## Other

- dry run (roz repo ka code dekh kr mind ma usko run karne ki koshish)
